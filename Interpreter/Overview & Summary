Interpreter : A component that processes structured text data. 
Dose so by turning it into seperate lexical tokens (lexing) and then interpreting sequnces of said tokens (parsing)

// boost spirit : let you build the parser using some predefined constructs 

Interpreter acts in two stages
1. Lexing turns text into a set of tokens, 
2. Parsing tokens into meaningful constructs
