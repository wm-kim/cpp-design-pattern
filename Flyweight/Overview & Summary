Avoiding redundancy when storing data - ex. store a list of names and pointers to them
bold or italic text in console - don't want each character to have formatting character. operate on ranges

Formal definition
: Space optimization technique that let us use less memory by storing common(공유) data object. allows to store externally
common data (Eg, static map)

Define the idea of 'ranges' on homogeneous collections
 - store data related to those ranges
 - and typically those data objects are called flyweights
