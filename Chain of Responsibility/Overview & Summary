Sequence of handlers processing an event one after another

A chain of components who all get a chance to process a command or a query,
optionally having default processing implementation and an ability to terminate to processing chain

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

CoR can be implemented as 
 - A chain of pointers. references (single linked list)
 - Centralized list 
 (in our case, the centralized implementation was an event broker where you basically had a signal 
 which you could connect to and thereby get notification.)

 // So basically there are two approaches. 1. decentralized 2. centralized
key difference for the CoR

either case have to enlist the objects in the chain, possibly controlling the order ( can sort it with priority )
object removal from chain (eg, disconnect from a signal)

goal : let a sequence of components process some information of one after another
