Sequence of handlers processing an event one after another

A chain of components who all get a chance to process a command or a query, optionally having default processing implementation
and an ability to terminate to processing chain

//////

CoR can be implemented as 
 - A chain of pointers. references (single linked list)
 - Centralized list 
 (in our case, the centralized implementation was an event broker where you basically had a signal which you could connect to and thereby get notification.)

 // So basically there are two approaches.

One is kind of decentralized and another is centralized. That's the key difference for the CoR

Enlist the objects in the chain, possibly controlling the order ( can sort it with priority )

object removal from chain (eg, disconnect from a signal)

[the goal is just to let a sequence of components process some information of one after another.]
