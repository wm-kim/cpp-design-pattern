Overview

Object creation logic becomes convoluted 
Constructor is not descriptive
- name mandated by name of containing type
- cannot overload with same set of arguments with different names
- can turn into 'optional parameter hell'

Object creation (non-piecewise, unlike builder) can be outsourced to
- a seperate function (factory method)
- may exist in a seperate place (factory class)
- can create Hierarchy of factories wit different factories for different types

Factory : a component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects

Summary

A factory method is a static method that creates objects 
A factory can take care of object creation
A factory can be external or reside inside the object as an inner class
Hierarchie of factories can be used to create related objects
