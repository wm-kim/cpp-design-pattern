Memento

keep some sort of token, which 특정 상태에 있는 object를 return 할 수 있게 한다.

An object or sytem goes through changes - (eg, bank account gets deposits and withdrawls)

there are different ways of navigating those changes

1. record every change (Command) and teach a command to 'undo' itself
2. save snapshots of the system

: A token/handle represent the system state. Lets us roll back to the state when the token was generated
  May or may not directly expose state information (typically an immutable construct.)

  ===================

  Automatic Memento 
  
  examples where you explicitly take the memento and you stick it whenever you want to actually restore the system to a particular state.
  can also have a memento which causes the restoration of the state in its destructor.


  =================

  Summary

  Momento are used to roll back states arbitarily

  is simply a token/handle class with (typically) no functions of its own

  A momento is not required to expose directly the state(s) to which it reverts the system

  can be used to implement undo / redo
