system behavior partially specified at runtime

Many algorithms can be decomposed into higher and lower level parts
The high level algorithm can be reused 

Formal definition : Enables the exact 'behavior of a system' to be 'selected' either at runtime (dynamic) or compile time (static)
Also known as Policy (esp, in the C++ world)

Summary

Define an algorithm at a high level

Define the interface you expect each strategy to follow
Provide for either dynamic or static compostiion of strategy in the overall algorithm
