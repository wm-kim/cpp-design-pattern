Object use other object's fields/ properties / methods through inheritance and composition.
composition let us make compound objects
A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compound objects in a uniform manner

=====================================

Object can use other object via inheritance/composition
some composed and singular objects need similar/identical behaviors

composite design pattern let us treat both types of object uniformly
C++ use duck typing, expecting enumerable type to provide begin() / end()
