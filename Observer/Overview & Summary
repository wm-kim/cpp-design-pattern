Observer : an object that wishes to be informed about events happening in the system. 
The entity generating the events is an observable

==========================

Summary

Two Participants:

  - Observable provides a way of subscribing to an event (signal)
  - Obeserver performs the subscription

Observable implementation is always intrusive (obsrever doesn't need to be.)
 - need to modify that class in order to support the idea of becoming an observable

 Mutlithreading/reentrant use can cause issues

 Ready-made implementation of observer are available
