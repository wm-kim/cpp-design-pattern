Mediator 

Facilitates communication between components 
by letting the components be unaware of each other's presence or absence in the system.

: A component that facilitates communication between their components without them nessesary being aware of each other 
  or having direct (reference) access to each other

make no sense for them to have direct references to one another, reference may go dead
all the object refer to central components that facilitates communication 

===================

Summary

Create the mediator and have each object in the system refer to it
 - E.g, in a field (constructor injection), typcially mediator is sigleton

Mediator engages in bidirectional communication with its connected components
Mediator has functions the components can call
Component has functions the mediator can call

Event processing libraries make communication easier to implement
