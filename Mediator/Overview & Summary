Mediator 

Facilitates communication between components by letting the components be unaware of each other's presence or absence in the system.

: A component that facilitates communication between their components without them nessesary being aware of each other 
  or having direct (reference) access to each other


===================

Summary

Create the mediator and have each object in the system refer to it
 - E.g, in a field (constructor injection), ∫∏≈Î sigleton

Mediator engages in bidirectional communication with its connected components

Event processing libraries make communication easier to implement
