State, GoF suggests that the state of the system kind of controls the way that it operates (FSM)

Changes in state can be explicit or in response to event (observer pattern)

: A pattern in which the object behavior is determined by its state.
  An object transition from one state to another (something needs event to trigger a transitions.)
  A formalized construct (which manages state and transitions) is called a state machine

  =======================

  Summary

  Given sufficient complexity, it pays to formally define possible states and events/triggers

  Can define 
   - State Entry/exit behaviors
   - Action when a particular event causes a transition
   - Gaurd conditions endabling/disabling a transition
   - default action when no transition are found for an event
