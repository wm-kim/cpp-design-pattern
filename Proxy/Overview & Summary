Formal definition
: An interface for accessing a paticular resource
That resources maybe remote. expensive to construct, or maybe require logging or some other added functionality

looks like a local object but acutally works as remote interface of somewhere else : communication proxy

proxy is that it's interface looks just like the interface of the object that you're actually attempting to access.

/////////////////

Proxy vs Decorator

Proxy provides an identical interface; decorator provides an enhanced interface

Decorator typically aggregates ( or has reference to ) what it is decorating; proxy doesn't have to 
can be a brand new object, not related to the underlying object at all

Proxy might not even be working with a materialized object (virtual proxy)

//////////////////

Summary

a proxy has the same interface as the underlying object
replicate the existing interface of an object and then, of course, you change its "underlying functionality."

Add relevant functionality to the redefined member functions 

Different proxies (communication, logging, cahces etc) have completely different behaviour

[ goal : change the behaviors of the object behind the scene but preserve the interface ]
