Want a object that representing an operation

Command

: an object which represent an instruction to perfrom a perticular actions.
Contains all the information necessary for the action to be taken

======================

Command & Query Seperation

Command = Asking for an action or change (eg. please set your attack value to 2)
-> which is mutable in the sense that it causes a mutation of the object, but it doesn't have a return value

Query = asking for information (please give me your attack value) -> typically not causing any mutations.

CQS = split system into seperate components and sepreate means of sending commands and queries
(can be implemented by the same components. or you can completely separate the system 
and actually keep two databases kind of synchronized)

* in GoF, the command design pattern actually encapsulates both command and quries
- since they are grabbing some instructions in an object are both represented by the command design pattern.

=====================

Summary 

Encapsulate all the details of an operation in a seperate object

Define instruction for applying the command (either the command itself, or elsewhere)

Optionally define instructions for undoing thee command

Can create composite commands (aka macros)
