Command

: an object which "represent an instruction to perfrom a perticular actions."
Contains all the information necessary for the action to be taken

======================

Command & Query

Command = Asking for an action or change (eg. please set your attack value to 2)
-> which is mutable in the sense that it causes a mutation of the object, but it doesn't have a return value

Query = asking for information (please give me your attack value)
-> typically not causing any mutations.

CQS = having a seperate means of sending commands and queries

* in GoF, the command design pattern actually encapsulates both command and quries

=====================

Summary 

Encapsulate all the details of an operation in a seperate object

Define instruction for applying the command (either the command itself, or elsewhere)

Optionally define instructions for undoing thee command

Can create composite commands (aka macros)
