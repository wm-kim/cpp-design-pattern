formal definition
: an object that facilitates the traversal fo data structure

iterator is a class that facilitates the traversal
- keeps a reference to the current element
- knows how to move to a different element

========================

Summary

An object can be iterated (traverse) if it defines a begin() / end() pair
An iterator specified how you can traverse an object

can invent your own kind of traversal and for each of traversal expose a different kind of iterator

iterator typcially requires of != and ++ operators 

++ is called sporadically, so cannot be recursive, but 
Courtines allow recursion through generator-yielding functions - more readable algorithm
