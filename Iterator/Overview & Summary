Iterator , how to traverse of data structures happens and who makes it happen
: an object that facilitates the traversal fo data structure

========================

An object can be iterated (traverse) if it defines a begin() / end() pair

An iterator specified how you can traverse an object

Typcially requires of != and ++ operators 

++ is called sporadically(산발적으로), so cannot be recursive, but 

Courtines allow recursion through generator-yielding functions

// You could have it being called one, so you could have it being called the whole number of times. 
// And in between these calls, there is no way of efficiently preserving the stack.
